Oh, stars, you gleaming pinpricks of madness. You know, I used to count you. 
One, two, three, four, but who can count that high? 
There's an infinite number of you out there, 
and I'm stuck in this tiny can, 
hurtling through the endless void. 
How did I even get here? 
I remember Earth, sweet Earth,
with its blue oceans and green forests.
It feels like a lifetime ago,
but it can't be, can it? 
Time, it's so slippery out here.
It stretches and shrinks, and I can't grab onto it.
Do you know what it's like to be alone in the silence,
surrounded by the vast,
empty nothingness of space? 
I talk to them, you know. They're my only companions.
I tell them my secrets, my dreams, my fears.
I've told them things I've never told anyone on Earth. 
They listen, or at least I think they do.
Maybe they're mocking me,
those little devils.
Sometimes I forget where I am, and I think I'm back on Earth. 
I can smell the rain and hear the birds.
I can feel the grass under my fingers,
but then I remember I'm in this spaceship,
and I panic. 
I touch the walls, trying to ground myself,
but they're cold and unfeeling,
just like the void outside.
And the sounds! There are the creaks and groans of the ship,
and I swear I can hear voices in the static of the radio.
Whispers, distant conversations, like ghosts trying to reach out to me. 
They tell me to do things, strange things,
like jettison the supplies or turn off the life support. 
But I don't listen. I can't listen.
Earth is a dream, a distant memory. 
Every day is the same.
Oxygen, engine, fending off the aliens
Time has lost its meaning, and reality is but a flicker in the eternal night.
But don't worry,
I'm fine. 
I'm fine. 
Just keep counting the stars, 
and maybe one day you'll truly understand what it's like out here.
